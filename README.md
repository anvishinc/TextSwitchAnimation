# Switch Text Animation react

## Installation

Just copy the ```switchTextAnimation``` component into your component dir and then import it where you want to use it.

## Usage

Check the implementation in homepage of this app or simply import the component and then place it in your syntax like
this 

```typescript jsx
    <div>
        <SwitchTextAnimation words={["Context", "Lilac", "Foobar", "Alphabetical"]} delay={4} />
    </div>
```

Give an array of strings to words parameter and the time delay between switch in seconds to delay parameter.

## Pending

I haven't gotten around to turning it into an npm package yet, but will get it done when I am free.
